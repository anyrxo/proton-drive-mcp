## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 16 or higher
- Proton Drive desktop app installed and synced
- Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible client

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install from npm (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g proton-drive-mcp
```

### 2. Or install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anyrxo/proton-drive-mcp.git
cd proton-drive-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Finding your Proton Drive path

The MCP will try to auto-detect your Proton Drive location, but you can also set it manually:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/CloudStorage/ProtonDrive-[email]-folder`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\[username]\Proton Drive`
- **Linux**: `~/ProtonDrive`

### Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "proton-drive": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/proton-drive-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Add to your Cursor settings:

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "proton-drive": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/proton-drive-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Proton Drive Path

If your Proton Drive is in a non-standard location:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "proton-drive": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/proton-drive-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "PROTON_DRIVE_PATH": "/custom/path/to/ProtonDrive"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

Once configured, you can ask your AI assistant:

- "List all files in my Proton Drive"
- "Create a new file called notes.txt with some content"
- "Read the contents of Documents/report.pdf"
- "Create a new folder called Projects"
- "Delete the file old-notes.txt"

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools

The MCP provides these tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `check_mount` | Verify Proton Drive is accessible |
| `list_files` | List contents of a directory |
| `read_file` | Read file contents |
| `write_file` | Create or overwrite files |
| `delete_file` | Remove files or folders |
| `create_folder` | Create new directories |

## üß™ Testing

Test if the MCP is working:

```bash
# Check if Proton Drive is detected
npm run test:connection

# Run all tests
npm test
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Proton Drive not found

1. Make sure Proton Drive desktop app is running
2. Check if your files are synced
3. Set `PROTON_DRIVE_PATH` environment variable manually

### Permission errors

### Tool not showing in Claude/Cursor

1. Restart your AI client after configuration
2. Check the logs for any error messages
3. Verify the path to the MCP is correct
